I learned to play it myself in 2019 (although I had been collecting the cards themselves since SOI). We've both been having a blast playing together and I'm genuinely surprised that she's so into it.",

I passed to combat and he used it to tap my werewolf, after which I cast howl of the hunt (flash enchantment that untapped my werewolf). I expected to be able to attack with it and win, but (on arena) it didnâ€™t let me, as if the combat step had already passed. Is it just me or should I have been able to attack with it after the effects resolved?",
